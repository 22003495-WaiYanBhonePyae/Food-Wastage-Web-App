            <p>Food wastage is a significant concern in Singapore, with households contributing substantially to the issue. Young homeowners, in particular, may engage in over-purchasing and subsequently waste food due to various cultural, economic, and psychological factors.</p>

            <h2>Cultural Factors</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Abundance Mentality:</b> The cultural inclination to ensure an abundance of food during gatherings often leads to over-preparation and purchasing more than necessary, resulting in leftovers.</li>
                <li><b>Social Status and Generosity:</b> Providing ample food can be seen as a sign of generosity, prompting individuals to buy in excess to meet societal expectations.</li>
                <li><b>Convenience Culture:</b> The popularity of convenience foods frequently results in excessive packaging waste and uneaten portions being discarded.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Economic Factors</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Bulk Purchasing:</b> Promotional deals and perceived cost savings encourage buying in larger quantities, but without proper storage plans, these purchases often spoil.</li>
                <li><b>Affluence:</b> Increased disposable incomes make young homeowners less cautious about over-purchasing.</li>
                <li><b>Cheap Food Prices:</b> Subsidized or low-cost food reduces the perceived value, leading to wastefulness.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Psychological Factors</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Impulse Buying:</b> Marketing strategies trigger impulsive purchases, leading to unnecessary acquisitions that are discarded.</li>
                <li><b>Overestimation of Needs:</b> A lack of meal planning results in over-purchasing.</li>
                <li><b>Cognitive Dissonance:</b> Many individuals acknowledge the negative effects of food waste but continue wasteful behaviors due to conflicting beliefs and actions.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Solutions to Mitigate Food Wastage</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Meal Planning:</b> Encourage better planning to reduce overbuying.</li>
                <li><b>Education on Food Storage:</b> Teach proper storage techniques to prolong freshness.</li>
                <li><b>Awareness Campaigns:</b> Initiatives like "Love Your Food. Waste Less. Save More." aim to educate the public.</li>
                <li><b>Encouraging Smaller Portions:</b> Advocate for cooking and serving smaller portions to prevent leftovers.</li>
                <li><b>Composting:</b> Promote urban composting to reduce landfill burdens and support climate action.</li>
            </ul>
